```
## 2. Navigate to the Code folder
```

### Q1. 
Execute lab0_q1.m on matlab. It will give the desired output on the command window i.e a random 5x5 matrix along with the bottom right 3x3 matrix and the sum of all it's elements.

### Q2.
Execute lab0_q2.m on matlab. It will generate two figures, one with the 2x2 grid of plots(graphs) with time going from 0 to 1sec with time intervals of 0.01 sec, while the second one with time from -10 to +10 sec in time intervals of 0.1 sec.
